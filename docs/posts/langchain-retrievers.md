## Retrievers
A retriever is an interface designed to return documents based on an unstructured query. Unlike a vector store, which stores and retrieves documents, a retriever's primary function is to find and return relevant documents. While vector stores can serve as the backbone of a retriever, there are various other types of retrievers that can be used as well.

Retrievers take a string `query` as input and output a list of `Documents`.

| Name | Description |
| ------------- |-------------|
| Vector Store-Backed Retriever | A vector store retriever is a type of retriever that utilizes a vector store to fetch documents. It acts as a lightweight wrapper around the vector store class, enabling it to conform to the retriever interface. This retriever leverages the search methods implemented by the vector store, such as similarity search and Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR), to query texts stored within it. |
| Multi-Query Retriever | Distance-based vector database retrieval represents queries in high-dimensional space and finds similar embedded documents based on "distance". However, retrieval results may vary with subtle changes in query wording or if the embeddings do not accurately capture the data's semantics. The `MultiQueryRetriever` addresses this by using an LLM to generate multiple queries from different perspectives for a given user input query. For each query, it retrieves a set of relevant documents and then takes the unique union of these results to form a larger set of potentially relevant documents. By generating multiple perspectives on the same question, the `MultiQueryRetriever` can potentially overcome some limitations of distance-based retrieval, resulting in a richer and more diverse set of results. |
| Self-Querying Retriever | A Self-Querying Retriever, as the name suggests, has the ability to query itself. Specifically, given a natural language query, the retriever uses a query-constructing LLM chain to generate a structured query. It then applies this structured query to its underlying vector store. This enables the retriever to not only use the user-input query for semantic similarity comparison with the contents of stored documents but also to extract and apply filters based on the metadata of those documents. |
| Parent Document Retriever | When splitting documents for retrieval, there are often conflicting desires: * You may want to have small documents so that their embeddings can most accurately reflect their meaning. If the documents are too long, the embeddings can lose meaning. * You want to have long enough documents so that the context of each chunk is retained. The `ParentDocumentRetriever` strikes that balance by splitting and storing small chunks of data. During retrieval, it first fetches the small chunks but then looks up the parent IDs for those chunks and returns those larger documents. |
