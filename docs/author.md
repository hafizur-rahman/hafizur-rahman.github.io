In my 23+ years of career, I worked in different domains like Affiiliate Marketing, Device Insurance, Pharmaceuticals, Auto Mobile etc. in different roles like Software Engineer, Team Leader, Solutions Architect, Project Manager. I was involved in various kind of projects like Mobile Applications and Games, Web Application, REST API, Data Engineering, Data Visualization, DevOps, Cloud Administration, Web Security etc.

I graduated from the topmost engineering university [BUET][buet] in Bangladesh in Civil Engineering. However, I got interested in programming and learnt C/C++, Java before my graduation. I gathered skills through on the job training and personal learning at educational platforms like Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, EdX. I obtained many professional certifications (Java, Hadoop, Spark, AWS, Scrum, Web Penetration Testing, ML/DL, Self Driving Car, Reinforcement Learning).
